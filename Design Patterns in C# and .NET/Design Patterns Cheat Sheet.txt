#Design Patterns Cheat Sheet

In this cheat sheet I will attempt to resume my own understanding of each design pattern
as well as add in some code snippets.


##1. SOLID Design Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle
States that any class should have only a single reason to change.
Separation of concerns.
Let's say we want to add persistance to a Journal class,
we could add save and load functions to the journal class.
However this violates the single responsibility principle.
The journal class should only take care of it's entries, and not how they are saved.
We should instead create a new class to handle persistance.
